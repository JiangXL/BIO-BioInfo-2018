# Review in final Course

1. Introduction of bioinformatics


2. NGS and Reads  Mapping

3. FM-index

Suffix tree compressed trie containing all the suffixes of th given text as
their keys and positions in the as their values.

Suffix array is a sorted array of all suffixes of a string. It is data

Property that makes BWT(T) reversible is "LF Mapping"

BWT reversing starting at right-hand side of T and moving left.

FM index is an index vombind the BWT with a few small auxilliary data
structures

4. Hap and Linkage Disequilibrium
Haplotype is a group of alleles in an organism that are inherited together
from a single parent. Linkage disequilibrium is the non-random assocation
of alleels at different loci in a given population.

Haplotype: The combination of alleles occurring on the same chromosome.

5. Data 

6. Vcf
DCoverage/depth is how many times that your data covers the gnome(on average)
Phred score, identical to the quality measure in ghe fe  

7. VCf
Genetic variants contain single nucleotied variant(SNV)( 

8. Identifying disease associated varinatns

How to analyse the data
allele based test, genotype-based test, haplotype-based test,
mulitiocus test.

9. 

10. Gene expression profiling and  RNA-Seq
RNA-seq don't need to design 探针, can discovery some new RNA.


11. Single cell can discovery 细胞亚型

12. Epienetics and  epigenome

13. Gene ontology

14. Population genetics
