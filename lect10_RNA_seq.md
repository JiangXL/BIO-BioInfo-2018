# Gene expression profiling
In the field of molecular biology, gene expression profiling is the measurement
of the activity( the expression) of thousands of genes at once, to create a global
picture of cellular function.

EST, SAGE, Microarrays and RNA-seq are used. From RNA-seq, we can do transcriptional
profiling(search for DE genes), SNP genotyping, DNA protein interaction(chip-Chip),
copy number variations(CNVs) detection and varous gene detection.

## Quantifying expression Methods for RNA-seq analysis
RPKM: Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads
$ RPKM = \frac{numReads}{Legth/1000 * totalNumReads/1000000}$
TPM:
