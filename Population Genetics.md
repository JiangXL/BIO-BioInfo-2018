# Population Genetics

##  Variation, recombination, haplotpes, and inference of 

LD, the gene is no random

为了避免数据的机制大，我们定义了LD

LD pattern

Recombination,

By shaping the landscape of indivual geneomes genration, recombinaton play an imprtant role.

THe coalescent that inetgrated recombination wsa ofetn freferred toas the ancestral recombination gph 

By considering wher e coalescent, recombinaton and muation happed on the tree, we are able to infer the impact of reombinaton on patterns of gnetic pattern.
