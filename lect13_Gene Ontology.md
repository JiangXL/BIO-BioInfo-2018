13. Gene Ontology

Gene ontology 是一个有向无环图(DAG), which provides a controlled vocabulary 
to describe gene and gene product in any organism. The purpose is to find 
unified, unambiguous, structured nomenclatures(二名法) fro the use of computer 
program.(“书同文”).

Ontology is philosophical study of the nature of being, existence or reality 
as such, as well as the basic categories of being and their relations. 
Traditionally listed as a part of the major branch of philosophy known as 
metaphysics, ontology deals with questions concerning:

- What entities exist or can be said to exist
- how such entities can be grouped, related within a hierarchy
- subdivided according to similarities and differences.

For information scientist. Ontology is terminologies with which axioms(公理) 
and definitions are associated, formulated in ways which make them suitable for
supporting software applications( for example in some Description Logic framework), such as: object orientated programming languages.

Gene ontology develop automated ways of deriving information about gene 
function from literature, and verifying models of genetics,

##  Gene Set enrichment Analysis(GSEA)

GSEA is a computational method that determines whether an a priori defined set of genes show statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states. (e.g. phenotypes)
