# Epienetics and Epignome

C.H.Waddington coined the term epigenetics in 1942 as pertainging to epignensis
in 1942 as pertaining to epigenesis. Epigenesis in the context of biology of 
that period referred to the differentiation of cells from their initial totipent
state in embryonic development. When waddington coined the term, the physical
nature of genes and their role in heredity was not known; he used it as a 
conceptual model of how genes might interact with their surroundings to produce
a phenotype; he used the phrase "epigenetic landscape" as a metaphor for
biological development. Now, epigenetics most often denotes changes in a
chromosome that effect gene activity and expression.

How epignemoes mark the genome? Epigenetics can be categoried as DNA modification,
Chromatin related change, RNA, Protein. We will introduct few method to detect
the epigentics.

## Bisulfite-Sequencing(BS-seq) for DNA methylation

DNA methylation will be divided to
canonical and non-canonical. Canonical DNA methylation is inheritable. Regulation
by DNA methylation.

tructural variation (also genomic structural variation) is the variation in structure of an organism's chromosome.

## Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing(ChIP-seq) 
ChIP-seq can predict the signaures of protein assocation and histion variants ans
histon modification.

## DNase-seq, ATAC-seq for chromain accessibility

## Hi-C, CHIA-PET for chromatin architecture
Chromosome con
