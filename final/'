# Background | What it is?

In 1960s, we known that:

- Single loci, Selection, Population genetic change

- But two-loci or mulit-loci do not.

So the paper provide some two-loci model.

# Background | What it is?
Here are results of Lewontin and Kojima:

1. If the fitnesses are additive between loci, linkage does not effect the 
final equilibrium state of the population. 

2. If linkage is tighter than the value demanded by the magnitude of the
epistasis there may be permanent linkage disequilibrium. 

3. The rate of genetic chagne with time is affected by the tightness of the 
linkage. 

4. In some cases stable gene frequency equilibria are possible only if linkage 
is tight enough.

# Background | What it is?
Three main modes of selection in natural and artificial populations:

+ **Heterotic Models**(杂种优势)

+ Series optimum selection

+ Undirectional selection(Neutral Theory)

# Mathematics of Selection and Linkage | What is the mean?
$$\Delta x_i = \frac{x_i \left( W_i - \overline{W} \right) - (- 1)^i R D
W_{12}}{\overline{W}}$$

Where, 
$$W_{ij}= the\ fitness\ of\ genotype\ whose\ frequency\ is\ Z_{ij}$$
$$W_i = \sum_{i j} W_{i j} x_j$$
$$\overline{W} = \sum_i W_i x_i$$
$R$ is the recombination fraction between the loci.
$$D=x_0x_3-x_1x_2$$(the linkage disequilibrium determinat)

# Mathematics of Selection and Linkage | What is the mean?
$$\Delta x_i = \frac{x_i \left( W_i - \overline{W} \right) - (- 1)^i R D
W_{12}}{\overline{W}}$$

At gene frequency equilibrium:
- $D=0$, on linkage disequilibrium
- $D=/0$, loss or gain of a gametic type by selection and by recombination

More locus can be expend by 2-locus equation.

These operations are easy to perform in computer.

# Heterotic Selection Model | How to representate? 
## Evidence:
Heterosis is important, then
$$degree\ of\ heterosis=f(number\ of\ heterozygosity)$$

## Hypothesis:
Epistatic(异位显性)
==>
interaction of linkage and selection

## Model to Test
- Two-locus model
- Five-locus model

# What about the following and question?

- Epistasis(异位显性) is required in order for linkage to be important in natural selection.

- Five-locus models show _cumulative_ effect of the linkage along the chromosome.
